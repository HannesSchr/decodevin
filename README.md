# Decode Vin Micro Service

This is a sample project for use in the Openshift demonstration.

It consists of a simple micro service written in Java, using JEE features to expose a REST service and access a relational DB.

This service can decode information for a given VIN (vehicle identification number) and to lookup a vehicle image from a DB.

This source code can be used to try out several features of Openshift.
